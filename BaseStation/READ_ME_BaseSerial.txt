The script interprets data packets sent over the serial bus from the sink node,
stores relevant data (node id and sensor data), adds it to an already
created Django database, fetches weather data from the Django database,
checks whether it's going to rain or not and then instructs the sink node
(via serial bus) on what to tell the node that sent the message.

Input:
Serial/Radio packets

Serial/Radio packets and entries in the Django database
