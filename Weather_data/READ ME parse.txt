This script iterates through an already downloaded XML-file with weather data from yr.no
It looks for precipitation (rain) entries and adds each rain entry and the corresponding date
(it's a 5 day forecast) into the already created Django database together with a timestamp
of when the entry was added to the database.

It then prints the weather forcast for the upcoming 5 days in the terminal.
It prints only rain and in millimeters per 24 hours.

Input:
data.xml = the downloaded XML file (downloaded with fetch.py)

Output:
Terminal printed 5 day weather forcast for rain in millimeters.
